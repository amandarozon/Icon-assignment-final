        <p>The African Burial Ground National Monument located at 290 Broadway, New York, New York.</p>

        <p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of the rediscovery of a centuries-old burial site located in lower Manhattan, an area formerly known as Little Afrika.

            Commemorated now by the African Burial Ground National Monument, the sacred burial ground serves as a reminder to locals and people around New York of the major role enslaved and free Africans played in building New York.  
            
            For New York City resident Desiree Rucker, it means a lot that this long forgotten history is acknowledged and celebrated every year.  “It means the memory will live on,” says Rucker who was at the site 30 years ago for the opening ceremony, “and the fact that even during COVID we can take a pause and remember the ancestors who probably endured illnesses and sicknesses far worse than COVID-19 means so much.”

            <p>In 1991, the General Services Administration was set to begin construction of a federal building at 290 Broadway in lower Manhattan.  The project was stopped when workers discovered human bones in the ground.  Archeologists, scientists, activists and others determined that the remains belonged to more than 15,000 enslaved and free Africans that “lived and labored” in New York, says the National Park Service.  It is estimated that the burial site, known to the people centuries ago as “Negroes Burying Ground,” was used from 1627 to the 18th century.  The site is now protected land under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and maintained and managed by the National Park Service.</p>
